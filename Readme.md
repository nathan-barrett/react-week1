## Description:
A recreation of an earlier project in Angular where Lew Davidson and myself made a marketplace for farm goods, and allowed Patrons to purchase a certain amount from the store.
## Application Objectives
_Patron_
* Display a menu of all available products.
* For each menu item display: Name, price, farm it was from and energy gain.
* Prices are color coded based on Prices.
* Energy level is color coded as well.

_Employee_
* Form for adding a new product to the menu.
* Option to edit the products properties
* Option to sell a product that will adjust the total quantity.
* Products with less than 10 left will be highlighted.

## React Objectives
* Before coding the project, spend some  time planning and drawing out the component architecture.
* Don't worry about any dynamic data, Just add hard-coded data directly into the project.
* Work on the project for a full eight hours.
